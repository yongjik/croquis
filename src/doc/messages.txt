Message formats between FE/BE
=============================

This document lists message formats: currently there's no schema enforcement, so
one should manually update this document whenever code changes.

Hopefully that's not too much effort.  (Using something like protocol buffer
would solve that problem, but it comes with its own dependency hassle ...)

resize (FE):
    # Tell BE that the width of the canvas has changed - also doubles as
    # initialization message.
    #
    # Currently we don't support changing height from FE, so height is always
    # supplied by BE in `new_canvas_config` message.

    {
        w: 800,  # Width of the canvas.
        h: 600,  # Height of the canvas: currently ignored.

        # Optional: state of the current canvas, so that BE can generate canvas
        # for the same region.  See axis_req below for `x_offset` & `y_offset`.
        #
        # If not present, BE generate canvas that shows the whole data.
        config_id: 123,
        zoom_level: 0,
        x_offset: 10,
        y_offset: 3,
    }

cell_fini (FE):
    # Called when the cell output is cleared, so that BE can free resources.
    # Contains no arguments.
    #
    # TODO: Not properly tested yet!

zoom_req (FE):
    # This message will trigger Plotter::init_canvas(), which will generate a
    # new canvas config according to the request, send back `new_canvas_config`
    # message, and start computing tiles (which will results in a bunch of
    # `tile` messages.)

        # current canvas config ID and zoom level used to generate this request.

                # For non-highlight tiles, we allow BE to *bump up* versions:
                # i.e., if version 234 is requested, by version 240 becomes
                # available while the message was enqueued, then we simply
                # generate tiles for version 240 and return it, because there's
                # not much point in generating *old* tiles.
                #
                # Also, if version is updated *while* we're generating tiles,
                # then the tile may contain inconsistent information, which is
                # indicated by having an odd version number in the response.

        # are duplicate requests we just attach old duplicate seq #'s to *any*
